  <h1><b><center>DARK MATTER</center></b></h1>
  <h2><b>The history of dark matter</b></h2>
  <p>In the mid-1930s, the Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky discovered that the galaxies in the Coma Cluster, one of the largest clusters known to us and comprising thousands of galaxies, do not move at all as predicted by calculations. The velocities of the galaxies turned out to be much higher than could be expected based on the observed total mass of the cluster. Zwicky showed that the galaxies in this cluster were moving faster than the second space velocity of the galaxy, which should have led to the destruction of the galaxy. This meant that the true mass of the Coma Berenices cluster was much larger than the visible one. He suggested that the cluster contains an invisible substance, which manifests itself only in the gravitational interaction. This non-radiating matter is called dark matter.</p></br>

  <h2><b>Evidence for the existence of dark matter</b></h2>
  <h3><b>Galactic rotation curves</b></h3>
  <p>In the 1970s, the American astronomer Vera Rubin studied the speed of rotation around the galactic center of matter located on the periphery of galaxies. According to Kepler's laws, which directly follow from the law of universal gravitation, when moving from the center of a galaxy to its periphery, the speed of rotation of galactic objects should decrease in inverse proportion to the square root of the distance to the center. But measurements have shown that for many stars this speed remains almost unchanged even at a very significant distance from the center.</p>

  <p>This phenomenon can also be explained by the presence of a hidden mass. A quantitative explanation of the observed dependencies of the rotation rate on the distance to the center of galaxies requires that this invisible matter be about 10 times larger than ordinary visible matter.</p>

  <h3><b>Gravitational lensing</b></h3>
  <p>In addition, if, according to the theory of relativity, any mass bends space-time, then light, passing nearby as if through a lens, is distorted and changes its direction. This effect is called gravitational lensing, and its degree directly depends on the mass. The distortion that a cluster of galaxies causes is so great that it is easy to notice. And it turns out that wherever such an effect is observed, there is some kind of hidden mass that enhances this effect.</p>

  <h3><b>Simulation of galaxy formation</b></h3>
  <p>Another important piece of evidence for the presence of dark matter in our world comes from calculations that model the formation of galaxies that began about 300,000 years after the start of the Big Bang. These calculations show that the mass observed in galaxies is not enough for their formation. The forces of gravitational attraction that acted between the expanding parts of the matter that arose during the explosion could not compensate for the kinetic energy of the expansion. Thus, the matter simply should not have collected into galaxies, which we can nevertheless observe. This problem was called the galactic paradox, and for a long time it was considered a serious argument against the Big Bang theory. However, if we assume that particles of ordinary matter in the early Universe were mixed with particles of hidden matter, then the formation of galaxies from stars, and then clusters from galaxies, becomes possible.</p></br>

  <h2>The concept and properties of dark matter</h2>
  <p>A very large number of facts indicate that there is some kind of unaccounted for mass, the gravity of which radically changes the behavior of galaxies. There was an assumption that these are weakly radiating brown dwarfs, substars, black holes, intergalactic gas. But all these objects emitted at least some kind of radiation. For a long time, scientists have been trying to find the causes of the hidden mass, but their attempts have not been successful. In the end, it was decided to admit that most likely there are invisible particles of a completely different kind, which they called dark matter (the word "dark" refers to the unknown nature of this substance).</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of these particles is that they do not participate in electromagnetic interactions. Therefore, they cannot be seen, because they do not emit, absorb or scatter light, radio waves, or any other electromagnetic waves that are used to study the universe. In addition to the above, dark matter freely passes through any objects and does not interact with them in any way. The only way dark matter manifests itself is the gravitational interaction.</p>

  <p>The average density of dark matter approaches the critical density of the Universe, i.e. is ~10<sup>-29</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is 10 times greater than the density of visible matter. Dark matter was intensively produced and annihilated at the early stage of the evolution of the Universe at temperatures of ~10<sup>15</sup> K and partially survived to this day. Searches and attempts to isolate dark matter particles are carried out at high-energy accelerators, for example, at CERN at the Large Hadron Collider. Dark matter particles can also be detected by the result of their collisions with atomic nuclei. However, the likelihood of such collisions is extremely small.</p>

  <p>Since dark matter particles cannot form atoms and molecules, and even more so stars and planets, they exist in the form of huge voluminous invisible halos surrounding galaxies, including the Milky Way. The total mass of dark matter is much larger than that of ordinary matter. For example, in the Milky Way, its mass is 95% of the total mass of the galaxy. Thus, it turns out that it is dark metrics that “dictates” what galaxies will be like and where they will form. It is in those places where the concentration of dark matter is greater that ordinary and visible matter accumulates, which then forms stars, planets, etc. Dark matter sets the large-scale structure and structure of the Universe.

  <h2><b>Candidates for dark matter</b></h2>
  <p>The main candidates for non-baryonic dark matter are the so-called <b>WIMPs</b> (Weakly Interactive Massive Particles). A feature of WIMPs is that they almost do not manifest themselves in interaction with ordinary matter. That is why they are the real invisible dark matter, and why they are extremely difficult to detect. The mass of a WIMP must be at least tens of times greater than the mass of a proton. Searches for WIMPs have been carried out in many experiments over the past 20–30 years, but despite all efforts, they have not yet been discovered.</p>

  <p>One idea is that if such particles exist, then the Earth, in its motion with the Sun in orbit around the center of the Galaxy, should fly through a rain of WIMPs. Despite the fact that WIMP is an extremely weakly interacting particle, it still has some very small probability of interacting with an ordinary atom. In this case, in special installations - very complex and expensive - a signal can be registered. The number of such signals should change throughout the year, because, moving in orbit around the Sun, the Earth changes its speed and direction of movement relative to the wind, consisting of WIMP. The DAMA experimental group, working at the Italian underground laboratory Gran Sasso, reports the observed annual variations in the count rate of signals. However, other groups do not yet confirm these results, and the question remains essentially open.</p>

  <p>Another method for searching for WIMPs is based on the assumption that during billions of years of their existence, various astronomical objects (Earth, Sun, the center of our Galaxy) must capture WIMPs that accumulate in the center of these objects and, annihilating with each other, give rise to a neutrino flux . Attempts to detect the excess neutrino flux from the center of the Earth towards the Sun and towards the center of the Galaxy were made on the underground and underwater neutrino detectors MACRO, LVD (Gran Sasso laboratory), NT-200 (Lake Baikal, Russia), SuperKamiokande, AMANDA (Scott station -Amundsen, South Pole), but so far have not led to a positive result.</p>

  <p>Experiments to search for WIMP are also being actively carried out at elementary particle accelerators. According to Einstein's famous equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, energy is equivalent to mass. Therefore, by accelerating a particle (for example, a proton) to a very high energy and colliding it with another particle, one can expect the creation of pairs of other particles and antiparticles (including WIMP), the total mass of which is equal to the total energy of the colliding particles. But the accelerator experiments have not yet led to a positive result.</p>
